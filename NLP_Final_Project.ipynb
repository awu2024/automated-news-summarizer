      "TOKYO: Tokyo stocks opened 0.74 percent lower on Wednesday, hit by the yen´s rise and drops on Wall Street on worries about falling oil prices.The Nikkei 225 index at the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 125.89 to 16,961.82 at the start.In New York on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.15 percent and the broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.26 percent, overshadowed by worries about sliding crude oil prices.The yen rose against other currencies on safe-haven buying, a negative for Japanese exporters as the stronger currency makes them less competitive abroad and erodes profits when repatriated.The dollar was at 117.72 yen early Wednesday, down from 117.90 yen in New York Tuesday afternoon and rates above 118 yen seen in Tokyo earlier Tuesday.The euro also fell after a key European central banker expressed support for monetary stimulus.The common European currency bought 138.69 yen and $1.1776 against 138.84 yen and $1.1777 in US trade.The ruble´s drop took a breather early Wednesday after plunging by around 5 percent on Tuesday as global oil prices tumbled towards a six-year low.The dollar was at 65.28 against the ruble on Wednesday against levels above 66 seen on Tuesday. \n",

      "Description: strong>KATHMANDU: A 36-year-old Dutch climber died while descending from the summit of Everest, the first to perish this year on the world's highest mountain, officials in Nepal said on Saturday.</strongEric Ary Arnold was among over 40 climbers who reached the 8,850 metre (29,035 feet) summit on Friday, but died later that day while coming down on high-altitude slopes known as the \"death zone\" because of the prevailing thin air, Tourism Department official Gyanendra Shrestha said. Mingma Sherpa of the Seven Summits Treks company that organised Arnold's expedition said his client complained of weakness while descending above 8,000 metres (26,246 feet) and probably died from altitude sickness. An earthquake last year killed at least 18 people at the Everest Base Camp, situated at some 5,400 metres (17,800 feet) altitude, and forced hundreds of climbers to abandon their expeditions.\n",

REVEL, France: Michael Matthews completed the full set of Grand Tour stage victories with a \"dream come true\" success at the Tour de France 10th stage on Tuesday. The 25-year-old Australian had already taken three stage wins at the Vuelta a Espana and two on the Giro d´Italia.\n",

      "Description: Singapore: Oil prices held above $43 a barrel in Asia Thursday after US commercial crude supplies rose at a slower pace while jitters over the shooting down by Turkey of a Russian warplane lingered. However, analysts noted that the increase was not as much as in previous rises and could be positive for prices in the longer term. At around 0115 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January was up eight cents at $43.12 and Brent crude for January was trading seven cents higher at $46.24.Ang said a report that durable goods orders in the United States, a barometer of the health of the world´s biggest economy, came in better than expected was also helping to perk up sentiment.\n",

      "Description: The dollar nursed losses last week after the Fed halved its outlook for interest rate increases to two from four by the end of this year and said an uncertain global outlook posed risks to the US economy. The dollar index, which tracks the US unit against a basket of six major rival currencies, added 0.1 percent to 95.417.The dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen to 112.11, pulling well away from Thursday's 17-month low of 110.67.The euro edged down slightly to $1.1237, moving away from last week's one-month peak of $1.1342.Sterling inched higher but remained pressured by concerns about Prime Minister David Cameron's ability to keep Britain in the European Union after leading 'Out' campaigner Iain Duncan Smith resigned from the cabinet late on Friday. Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday as hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve officials clouded the monetary policy outlook less than a week after Fed Chair Janet Yellen had set out a more cautious path to interest rate increases this year.</strongThe dollar got a mild boost from the suggestion that interest rate hikes could be on the way sooner rather than later.\n",

Australia faltered in their second outing as well after Perera, who registered his career-best figures of 6-70, sent the visitors packing in just 50.1 overs as the Sri Lankan players went into a celebratory huddle.\n",

And police chiefs warned of a rising number of \"opportunistic\" attacks on delivery drivers and are urging courier companies to take responsibility for their workers' safety.

Hamas's negotiators have returned to the Egyptian capital to resume long-running talks - brokered by Egypt and Qatar - that would temporarily pause Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for freeing hostages. An estimated 1.4 million people have taken shelter in Rafah after fleeing the fighting in the northern and central areas of the strip.\n",
